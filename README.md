# arm64_uboot-linux analysis

I plan to describe:
1. how to start up with u-boot (draft done, Continuing to fix errors)
2. how to execute Linux kernel (preparing to write)
3. how the kernel does


I am wonderring if something I wrote is correct

all the u-boot and kernel are base on K3, why? because I found all the device trees are easily found in u-boot and kernel.
